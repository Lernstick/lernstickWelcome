        <p>
            The Linux Advanced Teaching System provides a simple classrom
            management, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>web blocking</li>
            <li>screen locking</li>
            <li>students view</li>
            <li>students access</li>
            <li>groups</li>
            <li>bidirectional file copies</li>
            <li>exam environment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Hint:</b> The Linux Advanced Teaching System is different from
            the Lernstick exam environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Linux Advanced Teaching System is an add-on for the open
            Lernstick learning environment, the Lernstick exam environment is a
            completely different environment, specialized and hardened for
            executing exams and is usually not used during class.
        </p>
        <p>
            As with so many things in live, both variants have advantages and
            disadvantages. An optimal recommendation, which version to use, can
            only be given when all local circumstances are taken into account.
