            The menu option "backup" allows the configuration of the backup
            behaviour.

            In the section "Destinations" you can specify a local folder. The
            folder "/exchange/partition/" is the mount point of the Lernstick
            exchange partition.
            Unter dem
            In "external partition" you can specify the label of an additional
            stick, where another redundand backup will be saved.
            If the option "Save screenshot" is selected, a screenshot is saved
            with every backup. This is useful for educational research and
            evidentiary purposes.
